                Hi, I'm Daniel O'Neil. I am an aspiring full-stack developer based in Lansing, Michigan.
                I have a Bachelors of Science in Finance and Information Systems Management from Wayne State University, and I have full-stack development training from the MSU coding bootcamp.
                I am looking for either local or remote employment opportunities as I highly value my family and friends in the area and proximity to them is important to me.
                I hope this portfolio does a good job of exemplifying my skills in react, but I also have experience in the rest of the MERN stack, more basic full stack concepts like relational databases and Javascript.
                I also have some experience in fully offline programming in Java, C++, and some Python although you won&#39t find those represented in my github.
                Outside of work I love playing video games, watching sports, working out, spending time with my friends and loved ones, and cooking.
